# ECG-Classifier-LLM
1D CNN-based ECG Classifier with LLM-powered clinical explanation
This project implements a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database into five heartbeat classes.
It integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) (Gemini API) to provide human-readable clinical explanations for predicted heart conditions, enhancing interpretability for non-technical users and healthcare professionals.
The project includes signal visualization for better insight into ECG patterns.
